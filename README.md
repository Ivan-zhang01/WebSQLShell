WebSQLShell
===========

A one-page Web SQL shell.

A friend of mine recently asked to teach her some SQL. But she wants to practice at work during her lunch-break. And paranoid security rules of the place don't let her install ANYTHING on her machine or run any unapproved executable, though she can receive text files by e-mail. So I tried to find a Web SQL shell for Chrome browser she has and found nothing (maybe I just cant find the right words to ask google nicely). Then I just coded this thing. I know that WebSQL is a dead technology. But maybe sometimes it'll help somebody.
